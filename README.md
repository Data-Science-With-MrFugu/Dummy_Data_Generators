# Dummy_Data_Generators

There may be times when `testing` is needed and dummy data are not available. Two simple programs are created using `R` and `Python` to get anyone started. The `R` file has the ability to export data directly to a *PSql* database that already exists. The `Python` file is a general use case creating dummy data. 

# Requirements: 

+  **R**: 
`randomnames` | `generator`  | `RPostgreSQL` 

+ **Python**: 
`!pip install faker` | `!pip install usaddress`
